This is a test text file served as a static file from Netty server.

You can access static files from the resources/static directory by using the /static/ prefix in the URL.

Examples:
- /static/index.html
- /static/css/style.css
- /static/js/app.js
- /static/test.txt (this file)

The StaticFileHandler automatically determines the content type based on file extension.
